**Abrar's Public Knowledge Base**

Welcome to my personal knowledge management system built with Obsidian and maintained through Git version control. This repository serves as a curated collection of my technical notes, learning resources, project documentation, and educational content.

**Repo Structure**
I have all my notes (Which are all .md or Markdown Files) organized in various folders. This helps keep all my notes organized and also easier to find notes that I need to reference or edit.
